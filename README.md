# ERMA17
An open source telegram bot for monitoring etherum mining on nanopool.com.

It is written for __Windows 10__, but can easily be modified for UNIX systems.

### Following dependencies are needed:
```
https://github.com/corpetty/py-etherscan-api -> stored in te py_ethio_api folder, in case you want to use my version.
python-telegram-bot
requests
urllib3
base64
```
Just install them with the ```install_dependencies.bat``` script, or just use the ```pip``` installer. However, the python-etherscan.io api has to be installed according to the instructions found in the original repository.

Make sure, you add your Adress, Telegram-Token (in ```ERMA17_alpha.py```) and Etherscan.io API-Key (in ```/escan_api/api_key.json```) to the program.
